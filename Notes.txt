Notes for EKRB:


To do list:
  - Fix killing blow name bug
  - Fix date bug
  - Add sec-status
  - Add support for threads links (instead of just comments)
  - Abbreviate & round ISK values to millions
  - Add hover-to-view format
  - Add more pilot info (corp + alliance) for victim and pilot scoring the killing blow
  - Add support for 1v1 kills
  - Look into adding more features
  
  
Potential added features ideas:
  - Add more killmail websites
  - Add ISK to $ conversion
  - Add link to kill
  - Add PLEX conversion value
  - Add to all popular Eve-related subreddits
  
  
Bug list:
  - Crashes when it comes across a killmail with only one attacker
  - If NPCs are responsible for the most damage killing blow player name may end up as ammo.
  - If the killmail does not have all parameters (ex: "Related: Capsule") then the date will return incorrectly
