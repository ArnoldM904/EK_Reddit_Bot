Notes for EKRB:


To do list:
  - Add a function to find killboard URLs in comments
  - Add an isMatch function
  - Finish the basic form of the program
  - Modify and test in /r/Eve
  - Add to all popular Eve-related subreddits
  - Experiment and see how I can handle people submitting multiple killmails in one post.
  - Look into adding more features
  
  
Potential added features ideas:
  - Add more killmail websites
  - Add real money conversion?
  - Add PLEX conversion value?
  - Add # of involved players?
  - Show complete killboard info (In small text) ?
  
  
Bug list:
  - Hopefully none, haha. ;P
