Notes for EKRB:


To do list:
  - Add ISK to $ conversion
  - Add link to kill
  - Add pilot info (ship, name, corp, alliance) for victim and killing blow
  - Add system kill happened in
  - Add to all popular Eve-related subreddits
  - Experiment and see how I can handle people submitting multiple killmails in one post.
  - Look into adding more features
  
  
Potential added features ideas:
  - Display multiple killmails (if more than 3 post in pastebin?)
  - Add more killmail websites
  - Add hover-to-view format
  - Add PLEX conversion value
  - Add # of involved players
  - Add player names
  
  
Bug list:
  - Hopefully none, haha. ;P
