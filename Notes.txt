Notes for EKRB:


To do list:
  - Add ISK to $ conversion
  - Add more pilot info (corp + alliance) for victim and pilot scoring the killing blow
  - Add support for 1v1 kills
  - Look into adding more features
  
  
Potential added features ideas:
  - Add more killmail websites
  - Add link to kill
  - Add hover-to-view format
  - Add PLEX conversion value
  - - Add to all popular Eve-related subreddits
  - Round ISK (Ex: 123,456,789.00 ISK -> 123.46m ISK)
  
  
Bug list:
  - Crashes when it comes across a killmail with only one attacker
