Notes for EKRB:


To do list:
  - Add Reddit interaction to script
  - Test run in /r/Test
  - Modify and test in /r/Eve
  - Add to all popular Eve-related subreddits
  - Look into into BeautifulSoup4 and Scrapy to replace regex
  - Look into adding more features
  
  
Potential added features ideas:
  - Add more killmail websites
  - Add real money conversion?
  - Add PLEX conversion value?
  - Add # of involved players?
  - Show complete killboard info (In small text) ?
  
  
Bug list:
  - Has no working interaction with Reddit (Also it's more of lack of implentation yet than a bug)
  - Hopefully none, haha. ;P
