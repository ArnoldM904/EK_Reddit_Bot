Notes for EKRB:


To do list:
  - Fix killing blow name bug (with NPCs)
  - Add statements to convert "system X" to "the X system" when appropriate
  - Add sec-status
  - Add pilot information with top damage
  - Add support for threads links (instead of just comments)
  - Add hover-to-view format
  - Add corp and alliance for pilot scoring killing blow in a non-1v1 fight
  - Add ISK to real money conversion
  - Add a way to detect "MONDAY TRASH TALK THREAD" and modify killmail accordingly.
  - Look into adding more features
  
  
Potential added features ideas:
  - Add hover-to-view fitting info (with fitting link as display text perhaps?)
  - Add more killmail websites
  - Add link to kill
  - Add PLEX conversion value
  - Add to all popular Eve-related subreddits
  
  
Bug list:
  - If NPCs are responsible for the most damage killing blow player name may end up as ammo.
  - Bot does not handle NPC / structure deaths well, needs adjusting. Ex: (https://zkillboard.com/kill/45500149/)
