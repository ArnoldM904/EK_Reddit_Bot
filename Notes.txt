To do list:
  - Fix bugs
  - Add statements to convert "system X" to "the X system" when appropriate
  - Add sec-status
  - Add support for threads links (instead of just comments)
  - Add hover-to-view format
  - Add corp and alliance for pilot scoring killing blow in a non-1v1 fight
  - Add a way to detect "MONDAY TRASH TALK THREAD" and modify killmail accordingly.
  - Merge said posting support to interact with the EKR_Bot.py file.
  - Look into adding more features
  
  
Potential feature ideas:
  - Add to all popular Eve-related subreddits
  
  
Bug list:
  - Killmail URLs linking to kill groups instead of direct kills crash the bot. (Ex: /kills/freighters)
  - Killmail URLs ending with /#comments causes the bot to reply without killmail information.
  - If killmail is strikenthrough it replies without any scraped information. (Ex: http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/36wwbo/the_scope_jackdaw_enters_caldari_navy_service/crhs44k)
  - If NPCs are responsible for the most damage killing blow player name may end up as ammo.
  - Bot does not handle NPC / structure deaths well, needs adjusting. Ex: (https://zkillboard.com/kill/45500149/)
