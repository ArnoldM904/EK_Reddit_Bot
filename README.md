EVE: Online Killmail Reddit Bot (EKRB)

EKRB is a bot I made for the social media website Reddit. The purpose of the bot will be to search sub-reddits relating to EVE: Online (Ex: Reddit.com/r/eve), locate killmail links (Primarily through zkillboard), and then post information regarding the kill in a response to whomever linked the kill. (So that others can see the information quickly without having to click the link)

Version 1.0 supports zkillboard and posts the following information:
- ISK Dropped: __
- ISK Destroyed: __
- Total ISK: __

More features will be added in the future if desired.


Current technical specs / requirements:
- Python 2.7
- PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)

Please see the attached Notes.txt file for more information.
