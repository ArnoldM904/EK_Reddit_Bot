EVE: Online Killmail Reddit Bot (EKRB)

EKRB is a bot I made for the social media website Reddit. The purpose of the bot will be to search sub-reddits relating to EVE: Online (Ex: Reddit.com/r/eve), locate killmail links (Primarily through zkillboard), and then post information regarding the kill in a response to whomever linked the kill. (So that others can see the information quickly without having to click the link)

Version 1.94 supports zkillboard and posts the following information:
- ISK Dropped: __
- ISK Destroyed: __
- Total ISK: __
- Names of both victim and pilot scoring the killing blow and their ships
- The number of pilots involved
- The system the kill took place in
- The fitting of the victim's ship
- Date of kill
- Corp and alliance information for victim and pilot scoring killing blow (..mostly)

More features will be added in the future if desired.
