EVE: Online Killmail Reddit Bot (EKRB)

EKRB is a web-scraping bot that searches the /r/eve sub-reddit for posts containing killmail links before posting a reply to said post with the "TL;DR" of the killmail. This bot is primarily for mobile phone / tablet users who would otherwise be too inconvienced to view a killmail link or links, users with low connection speeds who load killmail pages very slowly, and lazy PC users who would rather quickly see the gist of the information rather than clicking 10 different links alike. EKRB is still in active development and could very much use any help, please feel free to look over the code, ask questions, and help improve it. :)

Version 1.951 supports zkillboard and posts the following information:
- ISK Dropped
- ISK Destroyed
- Total ISK
- Names of both victim and pilot scoring the killing blow and their ships
- The number of pilots involved
- The system the kill took place in
- The fitting of the victim's ship
- Date of kill
- Corp and alliance information for victim and pilot scoring killing blow (Dependent on killmail, see Notes.txt)

More features will be added in the future if desired.
Please see the attached Notes.txt file for more information.
