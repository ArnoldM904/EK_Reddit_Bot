EVE: Online Killmail Reddit Bot (EKRB)

EKRB is a bot I am currently making for the social media website Reddit. The purpose of the bot will be to search sub-reddits relating to EVE: Online (Ex: Reddit.com/r/eve), locate killmail links (Primarily through zkillboard), and then post information regarding the kill in a response to whomever linked the kill. (So that others can see the information quickly without having to click the link)

Alpha Version 1.0 is suspected to support zkillboard and post the following information: (According to time of kill)
- ISK Dropped: __
- ISK Destroyed: __
- Total ISK: __

More features will be added in the future if desired. (Such as other killmail websites or a ISK to $ value added.)



Current technical specs / requirements:
- Python 2.7
- PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)
- re
- urllib
